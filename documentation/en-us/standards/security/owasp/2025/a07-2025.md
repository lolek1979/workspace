# A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures

## Overview

Previously known as Broken Authentication, this category slid down from the second position and now includes Common 
Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) related to identification failures. Notable CWEs included are CWE-297: Improper Validation 
of Certificate with Host Mismatch, CWE-287: Improper Authentication, and CWE-384: Session Fixation.

# Description

Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session management is critical to protect against 
authentication-related attacks. There may be authentication weaknesses if the application:

- Permits automated attacks such as credential stuffing, where the attacker has a list of valid usernames and 
passwords.
- Permits brute force or other automated attacks.
- Permits default, weak, or well-known passwords, such as "Password1" or "admin/admin".
- Uses weak or ineffective credential recovery and forgot-password processes, such as "knowledge-based answers," 
which cannot be made safe.
- Uses plain text, encrypted, or weakly hashed passwords data stores see [A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures](./a02-2021.md).
- Has missing or ineffective multi-factor authentication.
- Exposes session identifier in the URL.
- Reuse session identifier after successful login.
- Does not correctly invalidate Session IDs. User sessions or authentication tokens (mainly single sign-on 
(SSO) tokens) aren't properly invalidated during logout or a period of inactivity.

## How to Prevent

|Mitigation|Solution|DEV|OPS|OCI|NIS|eVZP|
|----------|--------|---|---|---|---|----|
|Where possible, implement multi-factor authentication to prevent automated credential stuffing, brute force, and stolen credential reuse attacks.|Implement MFA where possible|YES|NO|NO|PR????|PR????|
|Do not ship or deploy with any default credentials, particularly for admin users.|Verify that no credentials are default|NO|YES|MO|PR????|PR????|
|Implement weak password checks, such as testing new or changed passwords against the top 10,000 worst passwords list.|Implement password check|NO|NO|NO|Not applicable|Not applicable|
|Align password length, complexity, and rotation policies with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-63b's guidelines in section 5.1.1 for Memorized Secrets or other modern, evidence-based password policies.|Implement requirement|NO|NO|NO|Not applicable|Not applicable|
|Ensure registration, credential recovery, and API pathways are hardened against account enumeration attacks by using the same messages for all outcomes.|Unclear, discussion needed|NO|NO|NO|Not applicable|Not applicable|
|Limit or increasingly delay failed login attempts, but be careful not to create a denial of service scenario.|Apply delay for logins|NO|NO|YES|PR????|PR????|
|Log all failures and alert administrators when credential stuffing, brute force, or other attacks are detected.|Log all attemtps|YES|NO|YES|PR????|PR????|
|Use a server-side, secure, built-in session manager that generates a new random session ID with high entropy after login. Session identifier should not be in the URL, be securely stored, and invalidated after logout, idle, and absolute timeouts.|Implement requirement|YES|NO|NO|PR????|PR????|
