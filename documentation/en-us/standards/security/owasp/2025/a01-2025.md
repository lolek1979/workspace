# A01:2021 – Broken Access Control

## Overview

Moving up from the fifth position, 94% of applications were tested for some form of broken access control 
with the average incidence rate of 3.81%, and has the most occurrences in the contributed dataset with over 
318k. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) included are CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information 
to an Unauthorized Actor, CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data, and CWE-352: Cross-Site 
Request Forgery.

## Description

Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically 
lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business 
function outside the user's limits. Common access control vulnerabilities include:

- Violation of the principle of least privilege or deny by default, where access should only be granted for 
particular capabilities, roles, or users, but is available to anyone
- Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL (parameter tampering or force browsing), internal 
application state, or the HTML page, or by using an attack tool modifying API requests.
- Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account, by providing its unique identifier (insecure direct 
object references)
- Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE.
- Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in or acting as an admin when logged in 
as a user.
- Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT) access control token, 
or a cookie or hidden field manipulated to elevate privileges or abusing JWT invalidation.
- CORS misconfiguration allows API access from unauthorized/untrusted origins.
- Force browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or to privileged pages as a standard user.


## How to Prevent

Access control is only effective in trusted server-side code or server-less API, where the attacker cannot 
modify the access control check or metadata.

|Mitigation|Solution|DEV|OPS|OCI|PRs|
|----------|--------|---|---|---|---|
|Except for public resources, deny by default.|Endpoints are secured, authentication is required|YES|NO|NO|PR????|
|Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them throughout the application|Create base containers introducing auth, rbac and abac features|YES|YES|NO|PR????|
|Minimize Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) usage|Minimize or remove it|YES|YES|YES|PR????|
|Model access controls should enforce record ownership rather than accepting that the user can create,read, update, or delete any record|Implememnt ABAC|YES|NO|NO|PR????|
|Unique application business limit requirements should be enforced by domain models.|Keep business domains separate|YES|NO|NO|PR????|
|Disable web server directory listing|Do not use static files, disable directory listing|YES|NO|NO|PR????|
|Ensure file metadata (e.g., .git) and backup files are not present within web roots.|Exclude these fiels from artifacts during build|NO|YES|NO|PR????|
|Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate|Implememnt audit and unknown url middleware|YES|YES|YES|PR????|
|Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated attack tooling|Setup infrastructure in appropriate way to handle these types of attacks|NO|YES|YES|PR????|
|Stateful session identifiers should be invalidated on the server after logout|Use proper mechanisms to ensure that|YES|NO|NO|PR????|
|Stateless JWT tokens should rather be short-lived so that the window of opportunity for an attacker is minimized.|Use short live tokens|NO|YES|NO|PR????|
|For longer lived JWTs it's highly recommended to follow the OAuth standards to revoke access.|Follow OAUTH2 standard|YES|NO|YES|PR????|
