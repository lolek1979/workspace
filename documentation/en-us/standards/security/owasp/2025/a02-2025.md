# A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures

## Overview

Shifting up one position to #2, previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure, which is more of a broad 
symptom rather than a root cause, the focus is on failures related to cryptography (or lack thereof). 
Which often lead to exposure of sensitive data. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) included 
are CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password, CWE-327: Broken or Risky Crypto Algorithm, and CWE-331 
Insufficient Entropy.

## Description

The first thing is to determine the protection needs of data in transit and at rest. For example, passwords, 
credit card numbers, health records, personal information, and business secrets require extra protection, mainly 
if that data falls under privacy laws, e.g., EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or regulations, 
e.g., financial data protection such as PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). For all such data:

- Is any data transmitted in clear text? This concerns protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP also using TLS upgrades 
like STARTTLS. External internet traffic is hazardous. Verify all internal traffic, e.g., between load balancers, 
web servers, or back-end systems.
- Are any old or weak cryptographic algorithms or protocols used either by default or in older code?
- Are default crypto keys in use, weak crypto keys generated or re-used, or is proper key management or 
rotation missing? Are crypto keys checked into source code repositories?
- Is encryption not enforced, e.g., are any HTTP headers (browser) security directives or headers missing?
- Is the received server certificate and the trust chain properly validated? 
- Are initialization vectors ignored, reused, or not generated sufficiently secure for the cryptographic 
mode of operation? Is an insecure mode of operation such as ECB in use? Is encryption used when authenticated 
encryption is more appropriate?
- Are passwords being used as cryptographic keys in absence of a password base key derivation function?
- Is randomness used for cryptographic purposes that was not designed to meet cryptographic requirements? 
Even if the correct function is chosen, does it need to be seeded by the developer, and if not, has the 
developer over-written the strong seeding functionality built into it with a seed that lacks sufficient 
entropy/unpredictability?
- Are deprecated hash functions such as MD5 or SHA1 in use, or are non-cryptographic hash functions used 
when cryptographic hash functions are needed?
- Are deprecated cryptographic padding methods such as PKCS number 1 v1.5 in use?
- Are cryptographic error messages or side channel information exploitable, for example in the form of 
padding oracle attacks?

## How to Prevent

Do the following, at a minimum, and consult the references:

|Initialization vectors must be chosen appropriate for the mode of operation. For many modes, this means using a CSPRNG (cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator). For modes that require a nonce, then the initialization vector (IV) does not need a CSPRNG. In all cases, the IV should never be used twice for a fixed key.|Follow this requiremnt|NO|YES|NO|PR????|PR????|
|Always use authenticated encryption instead of just encryption.|Implement this requirement (needs SWA discussion)|YES|NO|NO|PR????|PR????|
|Keys should be generated cryptographically randomly and stored in memory as byte arrays. If a password is used, then it must be converted to a key via an appropriate password base key derivation function.|Follow the requirement specification|YES|YES|NO|PR????|PR????|
|Ensure that cryptographic randomness is used where appropriate, and that it has not been seeded in a predictable way or with low entropy. Most modern APIs do not require the developer to seed the CSPRNG to get security.|Verify and implement requirement|NO|YES|NO|PR????|PR????|
