# A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures

## Overview

A new category for 2021 focuses on making assumptions related to software updates, critical data, and CI/CD 
pipelines without verifying integrity. One of the highest weighted impacts from Common Vulnerability and 
Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) 
include CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere, CWE-494: Download of Code Without 
Integrity Check, and CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data.

# Description

Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity 
violations. An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted 
sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs). An insecure CI/CD pipeline can introduce the potential 
for unauthorized access, malicious code, or system compromise. Lastly, many applications now include auto-update 
functionality, where updates are downloaded without sufficient integrity verification and applied to the previously 
trusted application. Attackers could potentially upload their own updates to be distributed and run on all installations. 
Another example is where objects or data are encoded or serialized into a structure that an attacker can see and modify 
is vulnerable to insecure deserialization.

## How to Prevent

|Mitigation|Solution|DEV|OPS|NIS|eVZP|
|----------|--------|---|---|---|----|
|Use digital signatures or similar mechanisms to verify the software or data is from the expected source and has not been altered.|Apply signing for libraires, containers and nugets|NO|YES|task or NOA|task or NOA|
|Ensure libraries and dependencies, such as npm or Maven, are consuming trusted repositories. If you have a higher risk profile, consider hosting an internal known-good repository that's vetted.|Use single source approach|YES|YES|task or NOA|task or NOA|
|Ensure that a software supply chain security tool, such as OWASP Dependency Check or OWASP CycloneDX, is used to verify that components do not contain known vulnerabilities|Incorporate the tools in CI/CD|NO|YES|task or NOA|task or NOA|
|Ensure that there is a review process for code and configuration changes to minimize the chance that malicious code or configuration could be introduced into your software pipeline.|Make sure code reviews are incorporated|YES|NO|task or NOA|task or NOA|
|Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline has proper segregation, configuration, and access control to ensure the integrity of the code flowing through the build and deploy processes.|Verify requirement|NO|YES|task or NOA|task or NOA|
|Ensure that unsigned or unencrypted serialized data is not sent to untrusted clients without some form of integrity check or digital signature to detect tampering or replay of the serialized data|Apply mTLS to verify client, enforce encryption on transport layer|YES|NO|task or NOA|task or NOA|
