## Preface

Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. 
It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled 
Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. 
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine 
(JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 

## OpenJDK

Standard Edition (Java SE). The implementation is licensed under the GNU General Public License 2
